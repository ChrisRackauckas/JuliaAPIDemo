# DifferentialEquations.jl Online

This is the front-end of [http://app.juliadiffeq.org/](http://app.juliadiffeq.org/), a website that solves differential equations in your browser using the power of [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).

## Installation

First, make sure you have node installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org) or with something like

```
sudo yum install nodejs
```

Next, install AngularJS via

```
sudo npm install angular
```

and install angular-cli using the instructions [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Clone the repo and navigate to it. Then run

```
sudo npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

## Local development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate a browser to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The development build of the website allows you to select the url of the API, so you can test it with a local instance of the API. To setup the backend API and run it locally, see [the repository for the backend](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqOnlineServer).  

# Development notes for the angular-cli front end

Everything that follows was automatically generated by angular-cli.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
